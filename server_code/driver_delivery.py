"""
Driver Delivery - Anvil Server Module (v5.8)
=============================================
Option C "Driver Marks Delivered" — mobile form that lets the truck
driver confirm physical delivery of a finalized trip at Starlite.

What this module does, at a glance:

    1. Driver opens the Anvil app on mobile, taps "Confirm Delivery".
    2. list_trips_awaiting_delivery() shows every Finalized trip that
       has not yet been delivered (transfer_trips.received_date IS NULL).
    3. Driver picks a trip → get_trip_assignments_for_delivery(trip_id)
       returns the per-SKU lines with planned qty pre-populated.
    4. Driver adjusts qty / adds a note where needed → tap Submit.
    5. submit_delivery_confirmation(trip_id, lines, driver_name) runs a
       single transactional cascade:
         - transfer_trips.received_date   := GETDATE()
         - transfer_trip_assignments      := Delivered + per-SKU detail
         - ai_transfer_recommendations    := Delivered (via
           FK_transfer_trip_recommendations, scoped by trip_id)
    6. ai_agent_log gets a TRIP_DELIVERED row with the cascade counts.
    7. If any line is a discrepancy vs. planned, sms_notifications.py
       fires a DELIVERY_DISCREPANCY SMS to the Hub Manager AFTER the
       DB commit (so a Twilio outage cannot roll back a valid delivery).

State machine this closes (v5.7 established Finalized; v5.8 adds Delivered):

    Pending -> Approved/Rejected/Paused -> Applied -> Trip_Assigned
        -> Finalized (cascade on Finalize Batch, v5.7)
        -> Delivered (cascade on driver Submit,   v5.8 — THIS MODULE)

"Received" is intentionally reserved for a future e21-integrated
Starlite receiving step. Do NOT use it here.

# =============================================================================
# Version:       5.8.4
# Last updated:  2026-04-29
# Changelog (this module only):
#   5.8.4 (2026-04-29) * BUG FIX: Hub Manager qty edits made in
#                        trip_editor (txt_qty -> update_assignment_qty
#                        writes to transfer_trip_assignments.adjusted_qty)
#                        were silently ignored by driver_deliver because
#                        get_trip_assignments_for_delivery never selected
#                        adjusted_qty and _planned_qty's COALESCE ladder
#                        only considered the recommendation-table fields.
#                        Result: driver UI displayed the original AI/
#                        calculated qty, not the manager's adjusted qty.
#                        Fix:
#                          - Added tta.adjusted_qty to the SELECT.
#                          - Inserted adjusted_qty as the highest-priority
#                            entry in _planned_qty()'s ladder.
#                        Companion fix in pick_list_pdf_generator.py v5.8.4.
#   5.8.3 (2026-04-28) * Cascade rec.status from BOTH 'Finalized' AND
#                        'Trip_Assigned' to 'Delivered'. Was previously
#                        'Finalized' only, which left pre-v5.7 recs
#                        orphaned in Trip_Assigned after delivery,
#                        padding starlite_addition in the v5.6
#                        PendingTransferQty CTE and silently suppressing
#                        fresh transfer recommendations across 113 SKUs.
#                        Paired with one-time historical cleanup in
#                        sql/cleanup_stale_trip_assigned_recs.sql.
#   5.8.2 (2026-04-23) * Two-text SMS model: DELIVERY_RECEIPT now fires
#                        on every successful delivery (new
#                        send_delivery_receipt_notification in
#                        sms_notifications.py); DELIVERY_DISCREPANCY
#                        still fires in addition when one or more lines
#                        diverge from plan.
#                      * Response envelope adds receipt_sms_sent and
#                        discrepancy_sms_sent fields; rolled-up into a
#                        back-compat sms_sent for older clients.
#   5.8.1 (2026-04-23) * Restored truncated tail of
#                        submit_delivery_confirmation (missing closing
#                        brace, except block, and finally conn.close()).
#                      * Added EXISTS filter to
#                        list_trips_awaiting_delivery so trips with zero
#                        transfer_trip_assignments rows (orphan finalized
#                        trips) cannot reach the driver UI.
#                      * Synced response envelope with client/driver_deliver:
#                        get_trip_assignments_for_delivery returns
#                        {trip, lines} envelope; submit payload uses 'note'
#                        not 'delivery_note'; client reads
#                        'assignments_delivered' on success.
#   5.8.0 (2026-04-22) Initial release of Driver Marks Delivered (Option C).
#                      Single-form UI with three internal views (home /
#                      confirm / success). Server orchestrates the
#                      transfer_trips -> tta -> recs cascade transactionally
#                      and fires DELIVERY_DISCREPANCY SMS on variance.
