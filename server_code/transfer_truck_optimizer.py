# =============================================================================
# Version:       5.20.0
# Last updated:  2026-06-12
# Changelog (this module only):
#   5.20.0 (2026-06-12) e21-fulfillment auto-cascade (order 600754
#                        incident): recs approved in the morning were
#                        shipped directly through e21 by the Hub before
#                        the optimizer packed them (Hub workflow drift).
#                        The v5.18 pack guard correctly skipped them
#                        (live Hub OH 0 = goods on the truck — WORKING
#                        AS INTENDED, prevented a double-ship), but the
#                        recs then sat 'Applied' forever, double-counted
#                        in the detection view (starlite_addition_active
#                        AND e21_in_transit_qty), and would have been
#                        packed + double-shipped once Hub on-PO stock
#                        arrived and live availability went positive.
#                        NEW _cascade_e21_fulfilled_recs pre-pack pass
#                        (runs BEFORE the v5.9 dedupe so a fulfilled rec
#                        can't be chosen as dedupe keeper): any Applied/
#                        Auto-Approved rec whose SKU has a SHIPPED
#                        (TRY_CAST(ord_item_status) >= 16) e21 transfer
#                        order with qty >= rec qty entered on/after the
#                        rec's review date is cascaded -> 'Delivered'
#                        (transfer happened; Cancelled would be false
#                        history) with note + E21_FULFILLED_CASCADE log
#                        row. Un-shipped lines (status 00/10) NEVER
#                        match — backorder-stub pattern; an entered
#                        order can still be cancelled. Surfaced in the
#                        optimizer status message and the e21_cascaded
#                        return key. One-time manual precursor for recs
#                        1514/1516/1517:
#                        sql/cascade_e21_fulfilled_recs_20260612.sql.
#   5.19.0 (2026-06-10) NEW callable cancel_zero_stock_recs — thin wrapper
#                        around the new Nexus stored procedure
#                        dbo.sp_cancel_zero_hub_stock_recs (see
#                        sql/create_sp_cancel_zero_hub_stock_recs.sql).
#                        Wired to btn_clear_zero_stock on trip_editor
#                        v5.19: the form calls dry_run=True to preview
#                        the candidate list for the confirm dialog,
#                        then dry_run=False to execute. Closes the
#                        v5.18 gap where pack-time-skipped recs (live
#                        Hub available <= 0, status Applied/
#                        Auto-Approved) were unreachable by the qty-0
#                        path because they never enter a batch. Safe by
#                        design: detection ignores zero-balance Hub
#                        SKUs, so a fresh rec is raised automatically
#                        when stock returns — cancelling never loses
#                        demand. Supersedes the one-time backfill
#                        sql/cancel_zero_stock_applied_recs_20260610.sql.
#   5.18.1 (2026-06-10) BUG FIX: first live run of v5.18.0 threw
#                        anvil.server.SerializationError — the
#                        skipped_no_stock list put transfer_qty into the
#                        run_truck_optimizer return value as
#                        decimal.Decimal (pymssql's native type for
#                        DECIMAL columns), which Anvil cannot serialize
#                        across the server/client boundary. Server-side
#                        work had already committed (batch + log rows
#                        were fine); only the response failed. Fix:
#                        int()/float() casts at dict construction.
#                        Lesson: anything destined for an
#                        @anvil.server.callable return value must be
#                        cast to plain Python types at the point it
#                        leaves the cursor — same convention the rest
#                        of this module already follows (see
#                        get_batch_details_flat's float()/int() casts).
#   5.18.0 (2026-06-10) Zero-Hub-stock handling (CV42LCSM0600 incident,
#                        2026-06-09/10):
#                        Background: a rec was approved, the pick slip
#                        printed, but the piece could not be physically
#                        located at the Hub. Cycle count zeroed e21;
#                        EasyMorph zeroed inventory_current. The rec
#                        then became IMMORTAL: get_eligible_transfers
#                        filters only on status+qty (never live stock),
#                        so every optimizer run re-packed it, and both
#                        exits available to the Hub Manager (leave
#                        unselected at partial finalize, or Cancel
#                        Batch) revert the rec to 'Applied' — straight
#                        back into the next run. No terminal
#                        "can't fulfill" path existed anywhere in the
#                        lifecycle. (The v5.12.1 dedupe even masked the
#                        symptom by auto-obsoleting newer duplicate
#                        recs 1387/1393 against immortal rec 1362.)
#                        Two changes:
#                        (1) NEW callable remove_assignment_cancel_rec:
#                            Hub Manager enters qty 0 in trip_editor →
#                            RowTemplate2 v5.18 confirms, then this
#                            deletes the tta row, recalcs (or deletes)
#                            the trip header, and moves the rec from
#                            any ACTIVE status to terminal 'Cancelled'
#                            with an appended note. Logs
#                            ASSIGNMENT_CANCELLED to ai_agent_log.
#                            'Cancelled' is excluded from the
#                            vw_unified_transfer_detection active
#                            allow-list automatically (it only credits
#                            Auto-Approved/Approved/Applied/
#                            Trip_Assigned/Finalized), so the phantom
#                            +qty drops out of effective on-hand — the
#                            unit isn't coming. Companion one-line
#                            change in pick_list_pdf_generator v5.18
#                            adds 'Cancelled' to the blocked-status
#                            deny-list.
#                        (2) Pack-time guard in run_truck_optimizer:
#                            recs whose LIVE Hub available is <= 0
#                            (LEFT JOIN inventory_current, missing row
#                            = 0 — EasyMorph drops the Hub row
#                            entirely when zeroed) are skipped before
#                            packing, stay 'Applied', and are reported
#                            in the status message + one
#                            SKIPPED_NO_HUB_STOCK ai_agent_log row per
#                            rec. They resurface automatically when
#                            stock returns, or can be cancelled via
#                            the qty-0 path / Transfer Approvals.
#   5.12.1 (2026-05-13) BUG FIX: delete_batch's cascade-revert (v5.9.0)
#                        was a silent no-op since the day it shipped.
#                        The SELECT used
#                          WHERE batch_id = %s AND status = 'Trip_Assigned'
#                        against ai_transfer_recommendations, but
#                        rec.batch_id is the AI review batch_id (e.g.
#                        '20260512-548dfc5f') while the function is
#                        called with the trip's batch_id (e.g.
#                        '20260513_141007'). Those columns hold
#                        completely different identifier spaces and
#                        never match, so the cascade returned zero
#                        rows on every Cancel Batch action and the
#                        downstream tta + trip DELETEs proceeded to
#                        orphan every Trip_Assigned rec on the batch.
#                        Orphans are invisible to the next optimizer
#                        run (which filters on status='Applied') and
#                        pad starlite_addition in the v5.6 view
#                        (LEFT JOIN to tta returns NULL, the ISNULL
#                        defensive default treats them as Proposed and
#                        counts them as virtual inventory). 11 orphans
#                        accumulated between 2026-04-23 and 2026-05-13;
#                        cleanup in
#                        sql/cleanup_orphan_trip_assigned_recs.sql +
#                        sql/cleanup_orphan_trip_assigned_recs_followup.sql.
#                        Fix: JOIN through transfer_trip_assignments to
#                        find the recs actually linked to the trip,
#                        same pattern revert_proposed_batches already
#                        uses correctly. ~12 lines changed inside
#                        delete_batch; consolidation path was already
#                        correct and is untouched.
#   5.12.0 (2026-05-04) * Dedupe filter: _dedupe_same_sku_applied_recs
#                        now excludes qty=0 ("approved no-op") recs from
#                        both the keeper-detection set AND the
#                        duplicate-detection set. Fixes the YS58D0800
#                        slow-bleed bug where ancient rec 404 (qty=0,
#                        Applied since 2026-04-02) silently obsoleted
#                        three subsequent fresh recs (666, 694, 731)
#                        for a total of 60 nullified units between
#                        2026-04-29 and 2026-05-04. SQL filter is in
#                        both the GROUP BY and the per-SKU SELECT so
#                        no caller path can bypass it.
#   5.9.0 (2026-04-23) * delete_batch cascade-revert: recs stuck at
#                        status='Trip_Assigned' when a batch is canceled
#                        are now auto-reverted to 'Applied' so they stay
#                        visible to the next optimizer run. Prior to v5.9
#                        canceling a batch left recs orphaned, invisible
#                        in both Trip Editor and Transfer Approvals —
#                        required manual SQL cleanup (see 2026-04-23
#                        YS12I0150 incident).
#                      * Optimizer dedupe-by-SKU: before packing, any SKU
#                        with two or more live Applied/Auto-Approved recs
#                        has its NEWER duplicates auto-obsoleted. Oldest
#                        rec wins (preserves review history). Prevents
#                        double-shipping the same SKU in one batch.
#                      * New action_types in ai_agent_log:
#                        BATCH_DELETED (cascade summary) and
#                        DUPLICATE_OBSOLETED (one row per obsoleted rec).
#   5.8.1 (2026-04-23) carve planned_time HH:MM truncation fix; clearer
#                      run_truck_optimizer message when Proposed batch
#                      already covers all Applied recs.
#   5.8.0 (2026-04-23) * finalize_selected_assignments callable — partial
#                        "carve and finalize" flow for the trip_editor
#                        checkbox column.
#                      * Layer 3 log stamping: BATCH_FINALIZED reason now
#                        includes (v{__version__}); new BATCH_PARTIAL_FINALIZED
#                        action_type for the carve path.
#   5.7.0 (2026-04-22) Trip_Assigned -> Finalized cascade in finalize_batch.
#   5.6.0 (2026-04-21) Effective-on-hand rollout (view-driven virtual supply).

  outside the app via a SHIPPED e21 transfer order.

  Incident (2026-06-12, order 600754): three transfers were approved in
  the morning; before the optimizer packed them, the Hub processed the
  transfer directly in e21 (the known Hub-does-the-full-e21-lifecycle
  workflow drift). EasyMorph then showed Hub on_hand 0, the v5.18 pack
  guard correctly skipped the recs (preventing a double-ship) — but the
  recs sat 'Applied' forever, double-counted in the detection view
  (starlite_addition_active AND e21_in_transit_qty), and would have been
  PACKED AND DOUBLE-SHIPPED the moment Hub replenishment (on-PO stock)
  arrived and live availability went positive.

  Match rule — a rec is considered e21-fulfilled when hub_transfer_orders
  has a row for the same SKU with:
    * ord_item_status >= 16 (SHIPPED — deliberately excludes 00/10
      entered-not-shipped lines; un-shipped e21 lines can linger at
      status 10 forever per the backorder-stub pattern, and an entered
      order can still be cancelled),
    * transfer_qty >= the rec's resolved qty (the Hub ships at least
      what the rec asked; e21 sometimes rounds up, e.g. 8 vs rec 4 on
      CV42SSV0200),
    * date_entered on/after the rec's review date (date-level compare —
      hub_transfer_orders.date_entered has no time component), so an
      old unrelated shipment can't resolve a fresh rec.

  Action: rec -> 'Delivered' (NOT Cancelled — the transfer happened;
  precedent: STALE_TRIP_ASSIGNED_CASCADE 2026-04-28) with an appended
  note + one E21_FULFILLED_CASCADE ai_agent_log row per rec.

  If two or more recs exist at status='Applied' (or 'Auto-Approved')

  batch. This happened on 2026-04-23 with YS12I0150: v5.5 auto-paused
  the newer duplicate, a reviewer un-paused it, and the optimizer
  packed both recs into the same trip.

  Rule: keep the oldest rec (lowest recommendation_id — created first,
  carries the earliest review history), obsolete the newer recs with
  an audit note and one ai_agent_log row per obsoleted rec.

  v5.12: Filter out qty=0 ("approved no-op") recs from both the keeper
  set AND the duplicate-detection set. Without this filter, an ancient
  qty=0 Applied rec — created when the Hub Manager overrode AI qty to
  0 to "approve no transfer" — sits forever and silently obsoletes
  every fresh meaningful rec for the same SKU on every optimizer run.
  This bit YS58D0800 three times between 2026-04-29 and 2026-05-04 (60
  units of nullified transfers via rec 404, qty=0 from 2026-04-02). A
  qty=0 rec is not a real transfer; it should never be a dedupe keeper
  and should never count as a duplicate of anything. The qty filter
  lives directly in the SQL so it can't be bypassed by callers.

  Called from run_truck_optimizer right before fetching the eligible
  transfer list, so the list it returns is already deduped.

def cancel_zero_stock_recs(dry_run=True, executed_by='hub_manager'):
  """v5.19: Wrapper around dbo.sp_cancel_zero_hub_stock_recs.

  Cancels every active-queue rec (Applied / Auto-Approved) whose LIVE Hub
  availability is <= 0. These are exactly the recs the v5.18 pack-time
  guard skips — they never enter a batch, so the per-row qty-0 path can't
  reach them. Wired to btn_clear_zero_stock on trip_editor v5.19.

  Flow: the form calls dry_run=True first and shows the returned rows in
  a confirm dialog, then calls dry_run=False to execute. Both calls run
  the same candidate SELECT inside the proc, so what the Hub Manager
  confirms is what gets cancelled (modulo an EasyMorph refresh in the
  seconds between — the proc re-asserts the state guard on UPDATE).

  Safe by design: detection ignores zero-balance Hub SKUs, so once stock
  returns a FRESH recommendation is raised automatically. Cancelling
  never loses demand.

  Returns:
    {'success': True, 'dry_run': bool, 'count': int,
     'recs': [{'recommendation_id', 'sku', 'old_status', 'transfer_qty',
               'hub_available_live', 'hub_on_hand_live'}, ...],
     'message': str, 'version': str}

  Serialization note (v5.18.1 lesson): every value is int()/str()-cast
  before it goes into the return dict — pymssql DECIMALs do not survive
  the Anvil server/client boundary. The proc already CASTs to INT, but
  the casts here make this function safe even if the proc changes.
